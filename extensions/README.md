# Pragmatic Extensions

These documents describe the extension plugins that complement `Pragmatic Web Toolkit`.

## Positioning

- **Toolkit core** = baseline functionality across all Pragmatic domains.
- **Extensions** = advanced / premium capabilities per domain.

Use this folder as the reference catalog for extension scope and packaging.
